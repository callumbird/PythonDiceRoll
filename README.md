# PythonDiceRoll
a python version of the previous program that takes system arguments

planned to be able to take arguments from being called from command line, or run without arguments, and writes output to a csv file.
first argument taken will be the number of times to repeat
every other argument will be a two character string, either the character 'd' followed by a number or the character 'm' followed by a number.
this will be split into dice, with the following number meaning the number of sides that dice should have, and modifer, with the number following meaning the modifier to add to the dice roll.
